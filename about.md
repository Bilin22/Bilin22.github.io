<h1 style="text-align: center;">About Me</h1>

In summary, I am a third-year undergraduate who is looking to learn more about the applications in statistical sciences as well as bioinformatics. 
I enjoy learning concepts in stats such as regression, survival analysis, and the imputation of missing data; I also 
enjoy applying bioinformatics methods to interpret genetic variants effects. 

Besides, I'm on my way to learn about making cool data visualizations in R.
In the future, I hope to deepen my knowledge and use these skills to tackle more real-world problems.

My hobbies include playing ukulele, listening to music (K-POP is my favourite genre!), and taking photos (check out Photos tab for photos I shot).

Here is my favourite quote from [Different Seasons](https://stephenking.com/works/collection/different-seasons.html) by Stephen King:

&nbsp;

`Some birds are not meant to be caged, that's all. Their feathers are too bright, their songs too sweet and wild. So you let them go, or when you open the cage to feed them they somehow fly out past you. And the part of you that knows it was wrong to imprison them in the first place rejoices, 
but still, the place where you live is that much more drab and empty for their departure.`
