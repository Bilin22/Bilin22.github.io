## Education  
----
<p style="float: right;"><b>Sep 2021 - June 2025</b></p>
**University of Toronto (St. George)**  
Honours Bachelor of Science - Statistical Science & Bioinformatics - ASIP Co-op Program

**GPA:**  3.96/4.00;  **Average:** A+


## Experience
----
<p style = "float:right;"><b>Apr 2023 - Present</b></p>

**Undergraduate Researcher with [Dr. Jochen Weile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jochen-weile-7a665767/?originalSubdomain=ca) and [Prof. Fritz Roth](https://thedonnellycentre.utoronto.ca/faculty/frederick-roth)**

*Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute @Sinai Health, Toronto*


* Re-processed the raw data underlying existing variant effect maps (atlas of the functional effects of all possible genetic variants on proteins) with the latest versions of the [TileSeqMave](https://github.com/rothlab/tileseqMave/tree/c60d66c92665467d38ab203b7b18a075e719be87), a bioinformatics pipeline for the calculation of fitness scores from sequencing reads and provides a suite of quality control visualizations.
* Compiled benchmark sets of variants with known pathogenicity from online databases and literature for each map.
* Evaluated the predictions made by different versions of variant effect maps using the precision-recall curve and use them to infer evidence strength for clinical interpretation by calculating the log-likelihood ratio for pathogenicity.
* Gave recommendations for optimizing the implementation of TileseqMave pipelines based on analysis results.
* Delivered presentation on the methodologies and key finding of this project to the entire lab and wrote a report. (My report can be viewed [**here.**]({{ site.url }}/assets/BCB330Report.pdf){:target="_blank"})

<p style = "float:right;"><b>May 2023 - Present</b></p>

**Research Trainee with [Prof. Kuan Liu](https://www.kuan-liu.com) and [Prof. Kevin Thorpe](https://www.dlsph.utoronto.ca/faculty-profile/thorpe-kevin-e/)** 

*Dalla Lana School of Public Health, Toronto* 


* Conducted a series of simulations in **R** statistical software to simulate Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs) with different outcomes (continuous, binary, repeatedly measured) under different missing mechanisms.
* Applied common missing data handling methods such as complete case analysis, imputations and inverse probability weighting to each simulated data set, and assessed their performance by employing a range of evaluation metrics.
* Provided recommendations on how to deal with missing data in RCTs based on evaluation results.
* Acquired in-depth knowledge and expertise in missing data methodologies, as well as the design and analysis of RCTs.
* Merged and wrangled simulated datasets to created data visualizations in **R** using **dplyr** and **ggplot2**.
* Gave a poster presentation on research showcase Day. (My poster can be viewed [**here.**]({{ site.url }}/assets/SUDS_POSTER_new.pdf){:target="_blank"})


## Projects 
#### (Click the hyperlinks to view my work.)
----
[**Treemap Applications**](https://github.com/Bilin22/Treemaps)
* Modelled different kinds of real-world hierarchical data using tree data structure in **Python**, such as modelling the file system, and modelling moves in chess games.
* Implemented recursive operations on trees, and developed an algorithm to generate a geometric treemap visualization.
* Leveraged the **os module** in Python to create a program that seamlessly interacts with computer’s file system.
* Used inheritance to design classes that share a common interface, allowing for code reusability and promoting a structured approach to object-oriented programming.

&nbsp;

[**Optimal Grouping Design**](https://github.com/Bilin22/Forming-Optimal-Groups)
* Implemented a **Python** program to put students into optimal groups with respect to different criteria and survey data.
* Compared different grouping algorithms including AlphaGrouper (groups student alphabetically), GreedyGrouper (forms groups using greedy algorithm), and SimulatedAnnealingGrouper (forms groups using simulated annealing algorithm).
* Visualized the scores of groups created by different grouping algorithms, as well as some simple statistics about how well they do using side-by-side bar plots.
* performed thorough **unit testing** on a complex program comprising multiple interacting classes.  

&nbsp;

[**Analysis of Hypertension & Low-Income Data in Toronto**](https://github.com/Bilin22/Hypertension-and-Low-Income)
* Extracted effective hypertension & low-income data from the CSV file using **Python**.
* Performed data cleaning & standardization and selected suitable statistical methods for analysis.
* Utilized the **object-oriented programming** paradigm to implement functions. Additionally, designed comprehensive test cases for each function to ensure thorough testing and validate program functionality.
* Drew conclusions regarding the correlation between hypertension rates and low-income rates on the neighborhood-level.
* Practiced skills in using Python and relevant libraries to conduct data analysis.
